</p>

<h2>Legal basis and your rights</h2>
<p>
    Where applicable, we process personal data on the basis of your consent and our legitimate interests (for example, to
    provide services, secure the website, and analyze usage). Depending on your jurisdiction you may have rights to access,
    correct, delete, restrict processing of, or obtain a copy of your personal data. To exercise those rights or withdraw
    consent, contact us at <a href="mailto:olievortex@olievortex.com">olievortex@olievortex.com</a>. You may also lodge a complaint
    with your local data protection authority.
</p>

<h2>Third-party services and transfers</h2>
<p>
    We use third-party processors to provide services on our behalf, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft Application Insights — analytics and telemetry;</li>
    <li>Kinde — authentication and identity management;</li>
    <li>Twilio SendGrid — email delivery and analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These processors may transfer or store data in the United States or other countries. Where required, we use appropriate
    safeguards for international transfers. Please review the privacy documentation of those providers for more details about
    their practices and privacy notices.
</p>

<h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
<p>
    We and our third-party partners use cookies and similar technologies for session management, security, preferences, and
    analytics. You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. Opt-out mechanisms may also be available from
    third-party analytics providers; consult their privacy documentation for details.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    We implement administrative, technical, and physical measures intended to protect personal information against unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Examples include access controls, encryption in transit (HTTPS), and secure
    configuration of hosting services. No method of transmission over the internet is completely secure; we cannot guarantee
    absolute security.
</p>

<h2>Minors</h2>
<p>
    Our services are not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
    children under this age. If you believe we have collected information about a child, please contact us and we will take
    steps to delete the information when appropriate.
</p>

<h2>Automated decision-making and profiling</h2>
<p>
    We do not use automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects. If this changes
    we will disclose details here and provide any required rights and safeguards.
</p>

<h2>Sale of personal information</h2>
<p>
    We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.
    We may share information with service providers who assist us in operating the website, but these parties are contractually
    prohibited from using your information for their own purposes.
</p>

<h2>Data breach notification</h2>
<p>
    In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and relevant authorities as
    required by applicable law. We aim to provide notification without undue delay and typically within 72 hours of becoming
    aware of the breach, where feasible.
</p>

<h2>Business transfers</h2>
<p>
    If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as
    part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy and,
    where required by law, seek your consent for the transfer.
</p>

<h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
<p>
    Our website does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals from browsers. However, you can control tracking through
    your browser settings, our cookie consent banner, and third-party opt-out tools provided by analytics services.
</p>

<h2>Links to other sites</h2>
<p>
    Our website may contain links to third-party sites or services not operated by us. This policy does not apply to those sites;
    we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.
</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are material we will post a prominent notice on the site
    or notify you by email if you have an account. The "Effective date" at the top of this page indicates when the current
    version became effective.
